# DecisionApp

The goal of this program is to help the user make a decision. To make the decision process more easy, the decision is split into multiple micro-decisions. The user first lists his options and the categories for the comparison. The user is then guided through the micro-decisions and has to select which option is more appealing to him. When all micro-decisions are answered, the decision result is calculated and presented to the user.

Future plans:
The current version is a command line based tool. To increase the accessibility the DecisionApp could be deployed as a web-app or client-app.
